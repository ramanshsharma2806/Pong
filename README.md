# Pong Game [![HitCount](http://hits.dwyl.io/ramanshsharma2806/Pong.svg)](http://hits.dwyl.io/ramanshsharma2806/Pong)
#### I made this game as the final project at the Summer Programming course at my school. It was made in the online Python IDE, [CodeSkulptor](http://py3.codeskulptor.org/about.html), that has the [simplegui](http://www.codeskulptor.org/) library conveniently installed.


## Methodology
#### The underlying power of simplegui is its simplicity and strength. It draws out the instructed graphics in a stunning 60 cycles every second. This allows the programmer to draw out the the updated images to create a gaming effect.

## Problems encountered
#### The most crucial problem I faced during the developement was that the ball did not correctly reflect off of the edges of the board. I overcame this by using a more definitive control flow in the program.

## To Play
#### To play the game: go on to this [link](http://py3.codeskulptor.org/#user301_KW4FrF5EcTAlgRQ.py) and press the **Run** button.
###### Note: You might have to click on the canvas(the black game background) in order to bring the game screen into focus so that the key controls would work.

## Comments appreciated
#### If you find a problem in the game, need help accessing it, or have a simple suggestion, please send me an email. Thank you.
