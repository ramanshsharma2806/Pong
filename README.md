# Pong Game
##### I made this game as the final project at the Summer Programming course at my school. It was made in the online Python IDE, [CodeSkulptor](http://py3.codeskulptor.org/about.html), that has the [simplegui](http://www.codeskulptor.org/) library conveniently installed.


## Methodology
##### The underlying power of simplegui is its simplicity and strength. It draws out the instructed graphics in a stunning 60 cycles every second. This allows the programmer to draw out the the updated images to create a gaming effect.

## Problems encountered
##### The most crucial problem I faced during the developement was that the ball was not correctly reflecting off the edges of the board. I overcame this by using a more definitive control flow in the program.

## To Play
#### To play the game: go on to this [link](http://py3.codeskulptor.org/#user301_MdYTXcPoFA_0.py) and press the **Run** button.
